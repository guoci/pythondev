Test the next Python

To evolve and remain relevant, incompatible changes must happen in Python. The
problem is how to migrate existing code to the "next" Python with these
incompatible changes.

Deprecation warnings
====================

DeprecationWarning and PendingDeprecationWarning warnings are hidden by
default, to not bother users. Developers can use ``-Wd`` (``-Wdefault``)
command line option on Python which displays these warnings.

`Python Development Mode <https://docs.python.org/dev/library/devmode.html>`_.

What's New in Python 3.9: `You should check for DeprecationWarning in your code
<https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.9.html#you-should-check-for-deprecationwarning-in-your-code>`_
section.

Top 5000 PyPI packages
======================

Download sdist and code search
------------------------------

* `download_pypi_top.py <https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/main/cpython/download_pypi_top.py>`_
* `search_pypi_top.py <https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/main/cpython/search_pypi_top.py>`_:

  * Run the search in parallel on all CPUs
  * Ignore C files generated by Cython
  * Ignore file extensions (programs, archives, HTML, etc.)

JSON
----

You can `download a list of top 5000 PyPI packages
<https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/>`_ in JSON format from hugovk
site.

INADA-san's script to download sdist packages from the JSON file:
`download_sdist.py
<https://github.com/methane/notes/blob/master/2020/wchar-cache/download_sdist.py>`_.

Note that this script doesn't download packages without sdist (e.g.  only
universal wheel). It is because INADA-san has searched Python/C API. The pain
of the removal can be reduced by fixing most of top 4000 packages.


Searching deprecated API usage
==============================

Sourcegraph
-----------

GitHub code search is not powerful enough and there is a lot of noise.  (e.g.
many people copy CPython source code). On the other hand, Sourcegraph only
searches from major repositories, and has powerful filtering. Example:
`search PyEval_ReleaseLock
<https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=PyEval_ReleaseLock+file:.*%5C.%28cc%7Ccxx%7Ccpp%7Cc%29+-file:ceval.c+-file:pystate.c&patternType=literal&case=yes>`_.

Docker images
=============

Barry Warsaw maintains `CI Images for Python
<https://gitlab.com/python-devs/ci-images/-/tree/master>`_. Example:
`.gitlab-ci.yml of flufl.lock
<https://gitlab.com/warsaw/flufl.lock/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml>`_.
