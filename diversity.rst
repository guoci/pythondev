    *"You can't solve people problems with software."*
    -- `Baldur Bjarnason

    *"Don't solve problems with software that should be solved with talking."*

    *"When women speak out about diversity and the community, they get
    penalized and branded as non-technical. Some women chose not to speak out
    because of this. We will not be silenced."*

    *"Increasing the core's diversity is a very important goal to ensure the
    future health of Python."*

First issue: become aware of diversity issues
=============================================

Usually, people involved since a long time in a project and who are in the
short priviledged group (ex: "core reviewers" or "core developers"), are not
aware of diversity issue. If there is no issue, who should anyone care of
diversity?

Why incidents are not reported or only reported privately:
https://discuss.python.org/t/discussion-about-recent-coc-events/5778/15

**Unconscious Bias** can be a first hint.

    Trying not to do any community engagement this month, but this is such high
    priority, and I can't stay silent. I'm so utterly heartbroken and
    disappointed to find out that there is a PyCon someplace 2018, and that it
    has 22 all male speaker lineup.

Diversity Statement:

    The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and
    encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual
    respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each
    other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more
    diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

For example, don't say "hey *guys*!" or "fellas" but "hey **everyone**!", forks
or "y'all": see `heyguys.cc <https://heyguys.cc/>`_.

Comment template:

     In the future please use gender-neutral words such as "folks" and "y'all"
     instead of "guys". Thanks.

`Nmap 4.50 Release Notes <https://insecure.org/stf/Nmap-4.50-Release.html>`_
(December 2007): Political correctness

    To cultivate a professional image, we long ago capitalized all references
    to God in error message text and also reworded all instances of “fucked up”
    to “borked”. We have now also changed this warning message: “TCP/IP
    fingerprinting (for OS scan) requires root privileges. Sorry, dude.” A
    woman reported that it was “highly offensive and sexist”, that “times have
    changed and many women now use your software”, and “a sexist remark like
    the one above should have no place in software.”

Being a Woman on the Internet

Stories unrelated to Python, or not directly related to the Internet. Its more
