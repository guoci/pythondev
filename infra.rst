Python infrastructure
=====================

* http://infra.psf.io/
* https://status.python.org/ Status of services maintained by the Python infra
  team
* https://github.com/python/psf-chef/

  - `doc/nodes.rst
    <https://github.com/python/psf-chef/blob/master/doc/nodes.rst>`_
  - `doc/roles.rst

* PSF pays a full-time sysadmin to maintain the Python infra: XXX
* https://www.python.org/psf/league/
* Managed services: http://infra.psf.io/overview/#details-of-various-services
* http://www.pythontest.net/ used by the test suite, see
  https://github.com/python/pythontestdotnet/

Services used by unit tests
===========================

* pythontest.net services:

  * `pythontestdotnet <https://github.com/python/pythontestdotnet>`_: source of
    pythontest.net (resources used for Python test suite).
  * test_urllib2net: http://www.pythontest.net/index.html#frag, tcp/80 (HTTP)
  * FTP: ftp://www.pythontest.net/README
  * Copies of unicode text files like http://www.pythontest.net/unicode/EUC-CN.TXT
  * test_hashlib test files like http://www.pythontest.net/hashlib/blake2b.txt
  * test_httplib: self-signed.pythontest.net, tcp/443 (HTTPS)
  * test_robotparser: http://www.pythontest.net/elsewhere/robots.txt
  * test_socket: испытание.pythontest.net

* snakebite.net::

    # Testing connect timeout is tricky: we need to have IP connectivity
    # to a host that silently drops our packets.  We can't simulate this
    # from Python because it's a function of the underlying TCP/IP stack.
    # So, the following Snakebite host has been defined:
    blackhole = resolve_address('blackhole.snakebite.net', 56666)

    # Blackhole has been configured to silently drop any incoming packets.
    # No RSTs (for TCP) or ICMP UNREACH (for UDP/ICMP) will be sent back
    # to hosts that attempt to connect to this address: which is exactly
    # what we need to confidently test connect timeout.

    # However, we want to prevent false positives.  It's not unreasonable
    # to expect certain hosts may not be able to reach the blackhole, due
    # to firewalling or general network configuration.  In order to improve
    # our confidence in testing the blackhole, a corresponding 'whitehole'
    # has also been set up using one port higher:
    whitehole = resolve_address('whitehole.snakebite.net', 56667)

* news.trigofacile.com:

  * Used by test_nntplib
  * NNTP (tcp/119) and and NNTP/SSL (tcp/563)
  * Server administrator: julien@trigofacile.com

* ipv6.google.com:

  * test_ssl uses it to test IPv6: HTTP (tcp/80) and HTTPS (tcp/443)

* sha256.tbs-internet.com:

  * test_ssl uses it to test x509 certificate signed by SHA256: HTTPS (tcp/443)
